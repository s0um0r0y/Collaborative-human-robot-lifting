# Efficient-Heavy-Object-Lifting-via-Human-Robot-Imitation-Learning-and-Advanced-Sensing

## Highlights

- UR5 arm with end-effector 6D IK (Position [X Y Z] and Orientation [R P Y])
- Enhanced Robotiq-85 / 140 gripper, with precise position control and experimental torque control
- Built-in YCB models loader (and obj models after decomposition)
- Gym-styled API, making it suitable for Reinforcement Learning in the field of push-and-grasp
- A heuristic grasping demo
- An interactive user-control demo

## Prerequisite
- Python 3
- PyBullet

## Run

You can try this repo with the interactive user-control demo.
```[Python]
python environment_setup.py
```
